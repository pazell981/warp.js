--Motivation--

Created this script to present the sites in my portfolio.  I plan on adding more formations than the diamond shape as well other options.

--Installation--

Include jQuery script and script src tag for warp at the bottom of page.

To use this script create a html div container with an id of "warpContainer" that holds the items.  Each item should be be a div container with a "warp" class.  Additional information should be held in a div with a class of "warp_desc" with in the parent warp div.  

The structure should look like:

	<div id="warpContainer">
		<div class="warp">
			<div class="warp_desc">
				...
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>

See index.php for an example of HTML structure.

A "data-offset" can be included in the "warpContainer" tag to push down objects vertically to off set for tool-bar or titles.
